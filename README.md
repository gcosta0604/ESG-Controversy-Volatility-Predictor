# Predictive-Model-for-Corporate-Controversy-Financial-Volatility
Using a longitudinal case study approach on Tesla , from Q2 2016 to Q2 2025, this research adopts a positivist philosophy and en embedded mixed-method design, sourcing data from Bloomberg and Yahoo Finance. The study leverages machine learning model (Random Forest Regression and Classification) to predict idiosyncratic volatility and controversy, with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values used for interpretation of models. The use of SHAP values for interpretation moves the analysis from merely predicting to explanation.
The analysis showed 3 important findings; first, the predictive power of Governance and social score on idiosyncratic risk and controversy, and the irrelevance of Environment score on the same. It also showed the negative causal relationship between the ESG component scores and risk. The research also found out the moderating effect of market volatility on risk prediction. 
This study provides a dynamic framework for ESG- risk analysis, linking stakeholder’s theory with big data analytics, to offer practical and replicable method of analyzing ESG data, advocating for regime dependent approach for ESG integration, using disaggregated ESG scores
